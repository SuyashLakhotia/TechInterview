# Pathfinding Algorithms

## Dijkstra's Algorithm (Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm))

1. Assign every node a tentative distance value. Zero for the start node and infinity for all other nodes.
2. Set the start node as current. Mark all other nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes.
3. For the current node, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. If the newly calculated tentative distance is smaller, assign the current node as the neighbor's previous node.
4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.
5. If there are still unvisited nodes, select an unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current node" and go back to Step 3.
6. Use the goal's previous node to recursively backtrack to the start node.

### Pseudocode

```java
HashMap<Node, Node> Dijkstra(Node[] graph, Node start, Node goal) {
    HashMap<Node, Integer> dist = new HashMap<>();
    HashMap<Node, Node> prev = new HashMap<>();

    PriorityQueue queue = PriorityQueue(graph, dist);  // Queue that stores nodes in ascending order of distance
    for (Node n : graph) {
        if (n != start) {
            dist.put(n, INTEGER.MAX_INT);
            prev.put(n, null);
        }
        queue.add(n);
    }
    dist.put(start, 0);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = queue.getMinimum();  // Get minimum distance node
        if (current == goal) return prev;

        for (Node neighbor : current.neighbors) {
            int altDistance = dist.get(current) + distance(current, neighbor);
            if (altDistance < dist.get(neighbor)) {
                dist.put(neighbor, altDistance);
                prev.put(neighbor, current);
                queue.updatePriority(neighbor);  // Update position of node in queue
            }
        }
    }

    return null;  // No path found!
}
```

## A* Search Algorithm (Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm))

The A* search algorithm is based on minimizing:

```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
```

where `f(n)` is the estimated distance of `START` to `GOAL` through `n`, `g(n)` is the known distance from `START` to `n` and `h(n)` is the heuristic distance from `n` to `GOAL`.

```java
HashMap<Node, Node> A*(Node[] graph, Node start, Node goal) {
    HashSet<Node> openSet = new HashSet<>();
    HashSet<Node> closedSet = new HashSet<>();

    openSet.add(start)

    HashMap<Node, Node> prev = new HashMap<>();
    HashMap<Node, Integer> gScore = new HashMap<>();
    HashMap<Node, Integer> fScore = new HashMap<>();

    for (Node n : graph) {
        gScore.put(n, Integer.MAX_INT);
        fScore.put(n, Integer.MAX_INT);
    }

    gScore.put(start, 0)
    fScore.put(start, heuristicEstimate(start, goal))

    while (!openSet.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = openSet.getMinimum();  // Get node with lowest fScore value
        if (current == goal) return prev;

        openSet.remove(current);
        closedSet.add(current);

        for (Node neighbor : current.neighbors) {
            if (closedSet.contains(neighbor)) continue;
            if (!openSet.contains(neighbor)) openSet.add(neighbor);

            int altGScore = gScore.get(current) + distance(current, neighbor);
            if (altGScore < gScore.get(neighbor)) {
                prev.put(neighbor, current);
                gScore.put(neighbor, altGScore);
                fScore.put(neighbor, altGScore + heuristicEstimate(neighbor, goal));
            }
        }
    }

    return null;  // No path found!
}
```
